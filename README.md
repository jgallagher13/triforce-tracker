## Triforce Tracker
- Triforce Tracker is an application that allows users to review The Legend of Zelda video games! 
- Triforce Tracker is a full CRUD application. 
- Users can login in through Google OAuth and add games to the application to review, add reviews to games, see the reviews of other users, delete their own reviews, and update the games they add. 
- The application uses the IGDB API to add a summary to the game details and to render an image for the game added in the all games page.

## Icebox Items
- As a user I want the home page to list the top 3 ranked games and show their cover images as this will demonstrate the usefulness of the site and will allow users to see valuable information right as they log in
- As a user I want to see a topic option in my review that lists various topics relevant to the game such as dungeons, enemies, graphics, etc. I then want to be able to sort reviews by topic because this will allow me to read reviews about topics I am interested in.
- As a user I want to add a game by searching for it in a search bar and when I click add game the id, summary, and release date is automatically added to the game details through the API, because this is an easier process than having to input information manually
